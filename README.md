# WorldFlightMap

Proof-of-consept conversion of WorldFlightMap to the new map API.

### "TODO"

- hide other (noisy) providers such as POI
	- maybe fade out others too, not sure how easy that'd be
- some taxi nodes are inaccurate, but idc
	- example is the flight point in Orgrimmar
- Argus is borked
- other things I might have missed
